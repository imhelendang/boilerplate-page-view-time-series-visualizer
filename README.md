# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This is my approach for the Page View Time Series Visualizer project with some help from the FreeCodeCamp forum. Please take my work as a reference not a solution.

For this project I will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I then use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help the viewers understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
